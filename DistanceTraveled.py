# Starting Out With Python 5th Edition: Chapter 2 - Exercise 5

# Define constant for current speed
SPEED = 70

# Calculate distance car travels in 6 hours
print('Formula: Distance = Speed x Time\n')
print(f'In 6 hours, a car traveling at 70 MPH will reach a distance of {SPEED * 6} miles')
print(f'In 10 hours, a car traveling at 70 MPH will reach a distance of {SPEED * 10} miles')
print(f'In 15 hours, a car traveling at 70 MPH will reach a distance of {SPEED * 15} miles')
